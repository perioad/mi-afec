# movingimage Angular FEC

Hello :)

Before you dive in into the code, I encourage you to pull the repo:

HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/perioad/mi-afec.git
```

or

SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:perioad/mi-afec.git
```

then run it locally:
```
yarn

yarn start
```
or
```
npm ci

npm start
```

and try to find 3 Easter ~~Eggs~~ Cats that I hid in the app.

Enjoy!
